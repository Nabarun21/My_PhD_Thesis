\chapter{Introduction}


The standard model of particle physics is the most complete description of nature available today. The discovery of the Higgs Boson added another feather to the hat of the standard model...

Besides confirming the mechanism by which particles acquire mass, this discovery has provided us a portal to look for and possibly study newer and exotic physics process. The search for such processes are generally referred to as search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM). One such interesting class of processes is those in which lepton flavor is violated in interactions involving charged leptons. In particular the decay of the Higgs into charged leptons ofdifferent flavor is forbidden by the SM if the theory is to be renormalizable. However, if the cut-off scale is finite such process can occur. Further many beyond the standard model extensions allow for such processes. These include susy models, randal-sundrum models, 2 HDM models. This interactions could be a strong indicator of new physics providing us with a strong motivation to perform searches looking for them.

This thesis describes a search for lepton flavour violating decays of the SM Higgs boson followed by a search for.... In both cases the search is performed in a channel where the Higgs decays via a lepton flavor violating interaction into a muon and a tau lepton with the tau lepton subsequently decaying to an electron....

The search is performed with data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC experiment. The results presented here build on and improve resultd from all such searches performed in the past.

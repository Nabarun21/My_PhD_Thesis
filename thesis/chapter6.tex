\chapter{Search for LFV decays of h125}

This chapter describes the analysis in search for lepton flavor violating decay of the h125 boson into a muon and an electronically decaying tau lepton. The motivation for this search is discussed in the introduction and theory sections. In the following sections the dataset and MC samples used, event selection and subsequent analysis strategy, systematic uncertainties affecting the analysis and finally the results are described in detail.

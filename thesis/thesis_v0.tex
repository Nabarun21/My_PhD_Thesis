% You should *also* have a ND formatting guide to ensure that you have
% all the relevant parts, put the captions in the right place, etc.
% Just because you have this wonderful style classfile doesn't mean
% that it removes *all* the formatting onus from you.  :-)
% Although be warned that the Graduate School has been known to let
% their official formatting guide get out of date. When in doubt,
% the Microsoft Word example seemed to be the only thing kept
% consistently up-to-date in 2013, and is probably the safest thing
% to consult.
%
% You should break all of this stuff up into separate files
% (at the very least, one chapter per file) and use the \include
% command, as has been done here for chapters 1 and 2 and the appendix.
% There is also an \input command, but \include is more commonly used to
% import chapters in books and dissertations. For the differences between these
% two commands, see, e.g., 
% http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~rdale/resources/writingnotes/latexstruct.html
% or http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include.
%
% If you compile from the command line, note that you should also have 
% a good Makefile; one that invokes LaTeX as many times as necessary 
% (up to 4) and bibtex if necessary.
%
% If you use an editor that allows you to compile from within the
% program, note that you will need to compile up to four times. Also,
% we recommend that you use pdflatex (sometimes displayed as
% LaTeX => PDF) to compile directly to pdf.

\begin{abstract}
This dissertation presents searches for Lepton Flavor Violating decay of the Standard Model Higgs Boson (h) as well as neutral Heavy Higgs Bosons (H) into a muon and an electronically decaying tau lepton. Data collected by the CMS detector in 2016, in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, at a center-of-mass energy of 13\,TeV were used to perform both searches. No evidence of signal was found in either search, and stringent upper exclusion limits were set on both processes. Observed (expected) upper limits on the branching fraction of h decaying into a muon and a tau lepton, $\mathcal{B}(\hmu)$, was set at 0.25 (0.25)\,\% at 95\% CL~\cite{HIG-17-001}. These are the most stringent limits set on this process till date. Observed (expected) upper limits on product of H cross-section and branching ratio to $\mu\tau$, $\sigma(\textrm{gg}\rightarrow \PH)\times\mathcal{B}(\Hmu)$ range from 51.9 (57.4)\,pb to 1.6 (2.1)\,pb, at 95\% CL~\cite{HIG-18-017}, for H masses in the range between 200 and 900 GeV. This search is the first direct search to set limits on this decay.

\begin{acknowledge}
  
  I would like to begin by thanking my PhD advisor and mentor, Prof. Colin Jessop. Colin guided, encouraged and supported me throughout all my endeavors during my PhD, both during the time spent at Notre Dame and doing research abroad at CERN in Geneva. A lot of what I have learnt and grown to be, in terms of scientific method, collaborating with fellow researchers and communicating what I have learnt to an audience were due to Colin's guidance.

  I would also like to thank my committee members Profs. Mike Hildreth, Randal Ruchti and Dinshaw Balsara for taking the time to review my research over the last few years, and providing feedback and encouragement. I would also like to thank Notre Dame and CMS faculty members, Profs. Kevin Lanon, Chris Neu, Nancy Marinelli, Sasha Ledovsky and others who advised me with my research from time to time. I am also thankful to Dr. Alexandre Zabi and Dr. David Petyt for their guidance and encouragement.

  Special thanks are in order for Dr. Silvia Taroni and Dr. Maria Cepeda Hermida who worked hard to teach me the ropes  of the trade. This includes everything an experimental particle physics student needs to learn from ground up, from programming to big data processing to preparing talks and posters to drafting physics papers.
  
  I would also like to thank the Notre Dame Physics Department for nurturing and supporting my growth as a scientist. I would especially like to thank Susan, Shari and Shelley in the physics office for helping me smoothly through many tasks over the years. I would like to thank my friends and colleagues Fanbo Meng, Prasanna Siddireddy, Michael Planer, Charlie Mueller, Robin Luo, Matthias Wolf, Anna Woodard, Carlos Alvarado, Fatemeh Elahi, Nathan Kellams for helping me learn and making research fun. I would like to thank my classmates James Kelly, Anthony Ruth, Allison Reinsvold, Elizabeth Louden, Rodolfo Capedevilla, Laura Collins, Ek Adhikari, Matthew Hall, Alison Deatsch and fellow chemistry PhD student Patrick Louden for being my family at Notre Dame.

  I would like to thank my parents, family and friends for being there for me over the years, believing in me and standing by me during hard times. I would specially like to thank my father for having encouraged me to do what I wanted during my formative years, and not to be influenced by the crowd, even if the chance for success was small.

  It wouldn't make sense for me to thank my wife, Namrata, because I consider everything I do as much hers as mine.
  
  Lastly, I would like to thank all the Yodas, Kenobis, scientists, technicians and engineers, not only associated with CMS and LHC, but every other experimentalist, theorist and Ewok whose collective work over millennia make little things like this thesis possible.

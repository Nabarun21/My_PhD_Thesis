% You should *also* have a ND formatting guide to ensure that you have
% all the relevant parts, put the captions in the right place, etc.
% Just because you have this wonderful style classfile doesn't mean
% that it removes *all* the formatting onus from you.  :-)
% Although be warned that the Graduate School has been known to let
% their official formatting guide get out of date. When in doubt,
% the Microsoft Word example seemed to be the only thing kept
% consistently up-to-date in 2013, and is probably the safest thing
% to consult.
%
% You should break all of this stuff up into separate files
% (at the very least, one chapter per file) and use the \include
% command, as has been done here for chapters 1 and 2 and the appendix.
% There is also an \input command, but \include is more commonly used to
% import chapters in books and dissertations. For the differences between these
% two commands, see, e.g., 
% http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~rdale/resources/writingnotes/latexstruct.html
% or http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include.
%
% If you compile from the command line, note that you should also have 
% a good Makefile; one that invokes LaTeX as many times as necessary 
% (up to 4) and bibtex if necessary.
%
% If you use an editor that allows you to compile from within the
% program, note that you will need to compile up to four times. Also,
% we recommend that you use pdflatex (sometimes displayed as
% LaTeX => PDF) to compile directly to pdf.
%
% If you have any suggestions, comments, questions, please send e-mail
% to: dteditor@nd.edu
